There are some correlations that we can infer from the data presented:
1) More spending per student does not correlate to overall passing percentage. In fact, with the data, there appears to be a negative inference.
2) School size does have a correlation with overall passing percentage. Once the school has more than 2000 students, there seems to be a diminishing in passing percentage.
    Schools under 1000 students and schools with 1000-2000 students are comparable.  Whether or not class size is an issue is not available in the data.
3) Charter schools seem to perform better than District Schools.
